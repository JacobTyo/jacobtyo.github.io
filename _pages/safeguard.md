<h1>Safeguard</h1>

During my senior year of college, as part of a four-person team we developed the safeguard application. This tool allows you to crawl the internet for information about a person, and then use the gathered information to determine your cyber visibility.  The video below highlights this functionality.  Furthermore, this appliation allows for the modification of existing photos.
