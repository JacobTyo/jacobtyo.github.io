<h1>Transferability of Deep Q Agents in Reinforcement Learning</h1>

In this project, I explored the transferability of deep-q agents in reinforcement learning.  The environments were selected on a loose notion of similarity (as I saw it), but mainly as these were some of the fastest to train so these experiments were plausible on my limited computational budget.  A writeup of this project can be found [here](/assets/pdf/rltransfer), and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/JacobTyo/RainbowTransfer).
