<h1>Security Issue Identification</h1>

Under [Prof. Katerina Goseva-Popstojanova](http://community.wvu.edu/~kagoseva/), I worked with NASA datasets to develop a system capable of detecting software issues that have security implications.  

An analysis of the datasets can be found [here](/assets/pdf/MS/nasadsbs.pdf) and [here](/assets/pdf/MS/nasajtkg.pdf), and more information about the deployed system can be found [here](/assets/pdf/MS/MSThesis.pdf) and [here](/assets/pdf/MS/nasasystem.pdf).
