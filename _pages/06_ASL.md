# The Tyo Sign Language Adventure

Alright fam, we've talked too long about learning more of sign language than just the alphabet. It is time we get to work! Here I've outlined a schedule and the resources we need. This schedule can be reworked but should serve as a good starting point and get us into a positive routine. 


This lesson plan includes three components:
1. Weekly Lecture Videos
2. Weekly Quizes
3. A monthly group call to put our new skills into practice. 

## Your Duties

Each week, watch the lecture video, complete the corresponding quiz, then text Jake your quiz score - this should take roughly one hour. At the end of each month we will all get together in a video call and practice our newly learned skills by talking ENTIRELY in sign language - thats right, NO talking! 

## Google Calendar

You can follow [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bW1rZm0yNGt0MGpsNjBidHU1ajhoaWM1ODRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) to get access to a Google Calendar with this same schedule on it, which will also send you alerts. Alternativly, you can email jacob.tyo@gmail.com with the subject "Add me to ASL Calendar" and I can add you manually. I'm looking forward to this adventure, and good luck!


## Video Chat Schedule

All chats will take place at 7:30pm EST.
